# MedMate-(Smart Medicine box)
Medmate is an automated smart medicine box that opens at the scheduled time of medicine intake. It is connected to a mobile app via Firebase, ensuring real-time synchronization. Users receive notifications, and the box opens automatically when it’s time to take their medication.



  # Technologies Used
- Flutter – For developing the cross-platform mobile app
- Firebase – For real-time data synchronization between the app and the smart box
- Embedded System (Microcontroller) – To control the smart box mechanism
- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module – For communication between the app and the box
